I am a passionate, creative, and detail-oriented UX/UI designer and web developer. My early interest in creative activities such as painting, drawing, and music led me to a career in Multimedia Production Engineering. My journey began in a startup, and I have solid foundations in programming, graphic design and 3D.

I love crafting innovative, simple, and functional solutions that make a positive impact on people. My curiosity drives me to explore and understand the world around us, enhancing user experiences on websites and applications. I am constantly seeking improvement and collaborating with diverse perspectives to create exceptional designs.

My goal is to create practical and appealing solutions that enrich people's lives. I am excitedto continue growing as a UI designer and contribute to the well-being of the community through impactful and functional design.
